### Lecture Notes and Tutorials
1. [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing], by [Yoav Goldberg].
2. [Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation], by [Kyunghyun Cho], the course note for DS-GA 3001 of NYU.
3. [A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning], an detailed and visualized tutorial of convolutional neural network. Especially the part of transposed convolution. Click [HERE](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic) to visit the tutorial's github page and obtain GIF animation of convolution processes.
